### Product Category 

- When analyzing the most purchased products, electronics are consistently the most popular throughout the year.
- As expected, home and garden products peak during the spring cleaning season. Similarly, health and fitness products perform well around the new year, reflecting the “new year, new me” trend.
- Kitchen supplies are frequently purchased, which makes sense as food is a basic necessity and a common passion.
